# Hardware-Constrained Learning for BNNs - Python package

A Python package for training BNNs with Genetic Algorithm.


## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone ...
cd HCL4BNN
pip install -e .

# or (if used for development)

pip install -e .[dev] 
```


## Usage

### `notebooks/example_run.ipynb`
This is an example for a full very coarse training with monitoring and result plots.

### `notebooks/example_run.py`
This is truncated version of above as an non-interactive example for e.g. cluster running.

### `notebooks/sipm_signals.ipynb`
This is a demo of the used simulated SiPM signals.
